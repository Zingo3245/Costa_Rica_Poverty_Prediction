# Costa_Rica_Poverty_Prediction

My entry in the [Kaggle competition to predict poverty in Costa Rica](https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction). Using a dataset from the Inter-American Development Bank, has provided a dataset to predict four levels of poverty. After cleaning the data, I fit a random forest classifer with 32 features to predict the different poverty levels in the test population.
